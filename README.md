From r/esapi question...https://www.reddit.com/r/esapi/comments/v5exps/filtering_patient_summaries/

Use at your own risk....be sure to read and fully understand prior to trying to use or adapt. 

This is a basic console application that can be used to search for relevant patients per the question's intent/goal. 
- It has NOT been validated or tested on the server...just an example of how you can perform such a search...
- Needs to be tested, etc. in case there are bugs
